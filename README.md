ML Python ChatBot

Team Members: Cosmin Raileanu, Ross Prizeman, Edvin Krasovski 

Background: We found that drug use throughout college students is quite common and realised that there aren't many resources that are easy and fast to access to educate young people about the risks, effects etc. We decided to create an AI Chatbot to allow for easy access to accurate information as well as that to make it more engaging and educational, additionally it allows for young people to ask possibly sensitive questions anonymously  

With the help/funding from the government it could be implemented into a government website and be advertised towards colleges/universities.
